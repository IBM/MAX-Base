[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/IBM/MAX-Base.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/IBM/MAX-Base)

This repository contains code for the "base" image used by all other
[Model Asset Exchange](https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/models/) models.

The base image is intended to contain requirements common across all MAX models to reduce the amount of packages that
need to be downloaded when downloading multiple MAX models.
